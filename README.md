# SocialWeb
Vrije universiteit Information science Social web course project about coronavirus.

The file 'casesDeathRecoveries.py' contains a Python script that gets the data provided by the following git repository:
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/
It outputs the current total number of confirmed coronavirus cases, deaths and recoveries. It also exports the number of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries per day to CSV files and plots this data on a graph.
